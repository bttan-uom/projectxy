		</div>
		<p>
In type 1 diabetes, symptoms are often sudden and can be life-threatening; therefore it is usually diagnosed quite quickly. In type 2 diabetes, many people have no symptoms at all, while other signs can go unnoticed being seen as part of ‘getting older’.
<br><br>
        <p>
          <br>
          Common symptoms include:
          <li>Being more thirsty than usual</li>
          <li>Passing more urine</li>
          <li>Feeling tired and lethargic</li>
          <li>Always feeling hungry</li>
          <li>Having cuts that heal slowly</li>
          <li>Itching, skin infections</li>
          <li>Blurred vision</li>
          <li>Unexplained weight loss (type 1)</li>
          <li>Gradually putting on weight (type 2)</li>

		</div>
		<p>
Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake) that stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.
<br><br>
With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t manage blood sugar levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and can be prevented or delayed with lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active.</p>
